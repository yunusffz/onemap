# Conventional Commits Configuration for Cursor

When generating commit messages, always follow the Conventional Commits specification:

## Commit Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

## Types
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

## Rules
1. Use imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
2. Don't capitalize the first letter of the subject
3. No dot (.) at the end of the subject
4. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
5. Reference issues in the footer using: Closes #123, Fixes #456, etc.
6. For breaking changes, add "BREAKING CHANGE:" in the footer

## Examples
- `feat(map): add marker clustering support`
- `fix(ui): resolve button hover state issue`
- `docs: update README with installation instructions`
- `refactor(hooks): simplify useMap hook logic`
- `chore: update dependencies to latest versions`
